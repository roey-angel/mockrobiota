Lagerh. (Cyanobacteria) Algae Collection Vienna (ASW 01028), Desulfosporosinus acidophilus strain SJ4T (DSM22704) (Firmicutes) (Alazard et al., 2010), Kosakonia sacchari (Gammaproteobacteria) (in house strain, 99.89% sequence identical (1105 bp) to K. sacchari SP1T (Chen et al., 2014)), Mesorhizobium loti strain R7A (Alphaproteobacteria) (Kelly et al., 2014), Nostoc microscopicum Vaucher (Cyanobacteria) Algae Collection Vienna (ASW 01020), and Telmatospirillum siberiense 26-4b1T (Alphaproteobacteria) (Hausmann et al., in press). DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions except that 200 µl of culture was first transferred to Lysing Matrix A tube and cells were disrupted using bead beating (30 s at 4 m s-1; FastPrep-24, MP Biomedicals) after adding PBS and AL buffers. DNA was then used for PCR amplification of the nifH gene using primers Ueda19-R6 as described above. PCR products were cloned using TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One clone containing nifH gene fragment from each strain was used for colony PCR amplification using primers M13, flanking the insert region. The identity of all isolates were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. The taxonomic affiliation and sequences of these isolates appear in taxonomy.tsv and expected-sequences.fasta. The taxonomy is based on the SILVA taxonomic classification, but the given nifH sequences cannot be used for classification using SILVA, since SILVA is an rRNA-gene database. phylogenetic_clusters_CART.tsv details the phylogenetic clustering of the isolates, which was done using [nifH-CART](https://wwwzehr.pmc.ucsc.edu/CART_model_public/).
